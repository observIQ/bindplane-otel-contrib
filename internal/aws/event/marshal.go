// Marshaler is an interface for marshaling SQS event bodies.
// It accepts multiple objects as input and allows multiple bodies
// as output in order to allow implementations to control how object
// notifications are batched into messages. This corresponds to realworld
// behaviors. e.g. S3 can be configured to batch multiple objects into a single
// message, while Crowdstrike FDR may require a message per object.
