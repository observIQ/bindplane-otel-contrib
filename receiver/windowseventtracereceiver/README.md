# Windows Event Trace Receiver (EXPERIMENTAL)

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT** ⚠️

This receiver is currently in an experimental state and should not be used in production environments. Users may encounter issues, bugs, or unexpected behavior. The component is under active development and its API, configuration, and behavior may change in future releases.

This receiver experimentally collects Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events from Windows systems. It creates an ETW session and enables specified providers to capture real-time events.



## Supported Pipelines
- Logs

## How It Works
1. The receiver creates a session with the specified `session_name`.
2. It enables the specified providers for this session.
3. It listens for events from these providers in real-time.
4. Events are parsed and converted to Otel log records.
5. Logs get sent down the pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Enabling analytic/debug logs in the ETW format
- Knowledge of the ETW provider GUIDs to monitor


## Useful tips

### Getting Started with ETW
- [Microsoft's ETW Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing) provides comprehensive information about Event Tracing for Windows
- [ETW Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/event-tracing-portal) explains the core concepts and components

### Finding Available Providers
To discover ETW providers available on your system, run the following command in an administrative PowerShell session:

```powershell
logman query providers
```

This command will display a list of all registered ETW providers, including their names and GUIDs. Use this information to configure the providers you want to monitor in the receiver's configuration.

### Best Practices
1. Start with a small set of providers and gradually expand based on your monitoring needs
2. Monitor the buffer size and adjust if you experience event loss
3. Use meaningful session names to help identify the source of events
4. Consider using attributes to add context to your events (e.g., environment, service name)

## Configuration
| Field                 | Type              | Default           | Required | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| session_name          | string            | `OtelCollectorETW`| `true`   | The name to use for the ETW session.                              |
| providers             | []Provider        | `[]`              | `true`   | A list of providers to subscribe to for ETW events.               |
| session_buffer_size   | int               | `64`              | `false`  | The size of the buffer in KiB to use for the ETW session. This shouldn't really be modified unless you are running into issues creating your `session_name`       |
| attributes            | map[string]string | `{}`              | `false`  | A list of attributes to add to all logs.                          |
| require_all_providers      | bool              | `true`            | `false`  | If true, the receiver will fail if not all providers can be enabled. |
| raw                        | bool              | `false`           | `false`  | If true, enables raw event logging.                               |
| include_log_record_original | bool             | `false`           | `false`  | If true, includes the raw XML event as the `log.record.original` attribute on parsed (non-raw) log records. Has no effect when `raw` is `true`. |

### Provider Configuration
| Field             | Type   | Default | Required | Description                                                                                                                                |

| name              | string |         | `true`   | The name or GUID of the ETW provider.                                                                                                      |
| level             | string | `""`    | `false`  | The trace level to collect. Valid values: `verbose`, `informational`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`, `none`. Defaults to provider configuration. |
| match_any_keyword | uint64 | `0`     | `false`  | Match events with any of the specified keywords.                                                                                           |
