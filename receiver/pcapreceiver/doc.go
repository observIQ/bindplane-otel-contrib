// Package pcapreceiver implements a receiver that captures network packets
// using system CLI tools (tcpdump on macOS/Linux, Npcap on Windows) and
// emits them as OpenTelemetry logs with hex-encoded packet bodies and
// structured attributes.
//
// This receiver requires elevated privileges (root on Unix-like systems) to
// capture network packets.
