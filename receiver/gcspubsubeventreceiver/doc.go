// Package gcspubsubeventreceiver implements a receiver that consumes GCS object event
// notifications from a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription and processes the objects
// containing log data.
//
// The receiver uses synchronous Pub/Sub pull to receive GCS event notifications. When an
// OBJECT_FINALIZE event is received, the receiver downloads the GCS object and processes
// it as log data.
